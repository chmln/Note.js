**Why another notification library?**

Existing js notification libraries are either:
* Forcing you to load jQuery, Bootstrap, or something else totally unnecessary
* ~~Ugly~~
* Specific to a certain framework
* Painful to use with bundlers, such as Webpack

Note.js is:
* **Lightweight** - `< 2kb` js+css
* **Framework-agnostic** (use it in React, Angular, Vue, or in plain HTML/JS environment)
* Compatible with **IE10+** and all major browsers
